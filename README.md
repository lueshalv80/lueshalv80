- 👋 Hi, I’m @lueshalv80, a Dr. (in Computer Science) but not the kind that really helps people.
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, DL-based and PCCR-based eye tracking, as well as in contributing to the development of privacy-aware AI/eye tracking.
- ✨ I have 7+ years of professional technical sales and solutions integration exp. (till today 2024-03) and have been able to secure key accounts (with values exceeding USD 750k+ yearly or ACV EUR 100k+).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a few new things and picking my piano & hockey knowledge (about SHL, HockeyAllsvenskan and NHL). In my free time, part of me enjoys creating home-made NNs and FL frameworks to tackle non-trivial problems in practice.
- 💞️ I am seeking a (senior) manager role/senior tech lead; committed to mentoring talents and driving innovations in privacy-aware eye tracking, all while upholding accountability, competence and a cross-cultural approach. From strong operational focus to visionary leadership. Skilled in engaging start-ups and fostering collaboration. 
- 📫 Let's connect here or on LinkedIn and have a sensational conversation. Såja!
