- 👋 Hi, I’m @lueshalv80, a Dr. (in Computer Science) but not the kind that really helps people.
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, DL-based and PCCR-based eye tracking as well as Privacy-Aware AI development.
- ✨ I have 7 years of professional sales and solution integrations exp. (till today 2023-09-01) and have been able to hit the USD *M+ annual sales quota (before joining Tobii).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a few new things and picking my piano.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the customer engagement & pre-sales solution integrations projects and initiatives driven by my team (Global Customer Success) at Tobii AB (Sverige), based upon a cross-team effort.
- 📫 How to reach me is a very solid question. Stay tuned!
