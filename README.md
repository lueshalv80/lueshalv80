- 👀 I’m interested in Python, DL-based and PCCR-based eye tracking and Privacy-Aware AI development.
- ✨ I have 7 years of professional sales and solution integrations exp. (till today 2023-08-22) and have been able to hit the USD 1M+ annual sales quota (before joining Tobii).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a few new things and picking my piano.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the customer engagement projects and initiatives driven by my team (Global Customer Success) at Tobii AB (Sverige).
